					<h1>About Me (Bio):</h1>
					<p class="bio">
						My name is James. I used to run a lot, but now I'm more focused on working to enhance my software development skills. I am from Folsom which is in Sacramento county. A fun fact about me is that I hold the vista del lago track 5K school record. I'm also interning at T-Mobile for the summer of 2020. Check out a picture of my dog, Lucky, who just turned 9 on the 19th of March, 2020.: <br> <br> <br>

						<br> <br> <br> P.S. I'm really sad because the gradient doesn't work like I want it to, update coming soon. Also, the mobile view is completely trashed lol. Fix in the future is coming!!! <br>

					<h1>Update for Tuesday, March 24, 2020:</h1>
					<p class="bio">
						<br>Hi everybody, I just wanted to share a bit about my current experiences with the self-quarantining that is required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I havn't been so productive lately, as I've mostly just been watching Netflix and playing animal crossing, but I do want to start on some work soon. My group and I are planning to complete some more work on our application, Komma, and we want to get a good chunk of it done soon. Additionally, I want to practice some Python programming by doing some stat and math calculations on the growth rate of COVID-19, and the rate of growth of the growth rate itself (like the derivative and 2nd derivative). It should help me brush up on some python scripting skills and some basic data analytics, more on that later as I complete the project. Finally, LA Hacks is coming up soon, and I'm considering doing a just a small project for it, nothing too difficult or time consuming (I want to enjoy my break too), but it would be great to produce another small product that I could put on my resume. Thanks for reading. <br> <br>
