          <h1>Finished with my first year at UCD!</h1>

          Yesterday, I finished my first year at UC Davis as a CS major! I wanted to write to reflect a little on how my first year went. So firstly, a major change from the start of the year to now is that I switched from the CSE to the CS major, and I now also have plans to get a minor in econ. This is something that I only decided after my winter quarter. The CS classes I took were ECS 36A, 36B, 36C, 20, and 50. I felt like i grew a lot as a CS major after this one year. I
          additionally worked on some cool projects on different platforms, like Komma for android, iOS, and web application. I also worked on a webpage in the #include club. I also participated in LAHacks, where me and some friends built a shopping inventory alerter in Python using the Twilio API. I grew a lot more than I thought I could as a software developor over this year. Now, I'm super excited to start my internship at T-Mobile in just about a week and a half!

        <h1>Custom Terminal and Vim.</h1>

        I wanted to share an ongoing "project" that I've been working on, which is my custom .zshrc and .vimrc, so I can share the settings I use for my zsh terminal and my vim. The github repository below shows the files, along with github links of the various plugins and other things that I use. I thought I would share this here because setting up my terminal and vim to best serve me has is pretty important.
