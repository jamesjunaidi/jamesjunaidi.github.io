					<h1>About Me (Bio):</h1>
					<p class="bio">
						My name is James. I used to run a lot, but now I'm more focused on working to enhance my software development skills. I am from Folsom which is in Sacramento county. A fun fact about me is that I hold the vista del lago track 5K school record. I'm also interning at T-Mobile for the summer of 2020. Check out a picture of my dog, Lucky, who just turned 9 on the 19th of March, 2020.: <br> <br> <br>

						<br> <br> <br> P.S. I'm really sad because the gradient doesn't work like I want it to, update coming soon. Also, the mobile view is completely trashed lol. Fix in the future is coming!!! <br>

					<h1>Update for Sunday, March 29.</h1>

						Hi everybody, I'm writing today to talk about my experience at the virtual LAHacks 2020 event. I worked with some of my friends on an application that notifies people through text about the stocking of certain supplies that are important during this COVID-19 pandemic. See the devpost link for more information! I thought it was pretty cool how we got it to work fully.
