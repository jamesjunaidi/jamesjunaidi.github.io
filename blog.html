        </div>
         <p>
          So, we have finally reached July. That means we are done with half of 2020. This year has indeed been crazy. I never imagined I would have spent my entire spring quarter remotely, or my internship remotely as well. Professionally, I feel like I missed out on a lot of development and connections that I would've had if I was on campus, or even in the office for my internship. But realistically, the remote options have been better than nothing. Kudos to T-Mobile for putting
          together an actually great remote internship program. I feel that even though I'm missing out on meeting people, I'm also able to connect with nationwide interns that I probably would've otherwise not had the chance too. Most of the interns seem to be in Washington, and I've been able to connect with quite a few of them and I don't know if I would've had that chance had the internship been in person. I think you can find a bright side to most situations that you may not find ideal,
          and that will help your mindset when bad things come along.

          <h1>The end of my summer break...</h1>

          Today marks the last day of the first part of my summer break. Tomorrow I begin working at my internship, and next week I begin my linear algebra class. Over this great 1.5 week break, I got to take a break after a stressful quarter of work in quarantine. I watched a couple TV shows and movies, and I started running and biking again. The highlight of my break was definately going to Tahoe and hiking up Rubicon Peak. I am excited to begin some consistent work again and I will have the
          second part of my break later in mid September when my internship ends.

          <h1>Finished with my first year at UCD!</h1>

          Yesterday, I finished my first year at UC Davis as a CS major! I wanted to write to reflect a little on how my first year went. So firstly, a major change from the start of the year to now is that I switched from the CSE to the CS major, and I now also have plans to get a minor in econ. This is something that I only decided after my winter quarter. The CS classes I took were ECS 36A, 36B, 36C, 20, and 50. I felt like i grew a lot as a CS major after this one year. I
          additionally worked on some cool projects on different platforms, like Komma for android, iOS, and web application. I also worked on a webpage in the #include club. I also participated in LAHacks, where me and some friends built a shopping inventory alerter in Python using the Twilio API. I grew a lot more than I thought I could as a software developor over this year. Now, I'm super excited to start my internship at T-Mobile in just about a week and a half!

        I wanted to share an ongoing "project" that I've been working on, which is my custom .zshrc and .vimrc, so I can share the settings I use for my zsh terminal and my vim. The github repository below shows the files, along with github links of the various plugins and other things that I use. I thought I would share this here because setting up my terminal and vim to best serve me has is pretty important.
